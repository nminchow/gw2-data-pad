# Salutations!
## Welcome to your data pad.

The datapad is an overlay to help keep relevant Guild Wars 2 data at your fingertips.

## Instructions

Hit `shift` + `enter` to open your data-pad from in-game. You can then start typing and the data-pad will search the wiki for relevant info pertaining to your query. Hit `esc` to return to the game. If you find something useful, copy it to your clipboard before closing the data-pad, and it will be pasted into your chat window when you hit `esc`.
